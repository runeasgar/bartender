# yourmodule.routing.yml defines "routes" and information about routes.
# Routes must still also be declared using hook_menu, but this yml file handles most of the info.

# This route will define the home experience for bartender.
bartender.home:
  # According to https://drupal.org/node/2051097 this should be path,
  # but path results in "Notice" errors and in a non-functioning path.
  path: '/bartender/home'
  defaults:
    # This points to the function that delivers the content for the route.
    # It uses namespacing, not file path. Not sure why it's called staticly.
    _content: '\Drupal\bartender\Controller\BartenderController::home'
  requirements:
    # This is how we restrict access to the route to a particular permission. Case sensitive!
    _permission: 'use bartender'

bartender.settings:
  path: '/admin/config/bartender/settings'
  defaults:
    # In this case we're routing to a form object, not a controller action.
    _form: '\Drupal\bartender\Form\BartenderConfigForm'
  requirements:
    _permission: 'administer bartender'
